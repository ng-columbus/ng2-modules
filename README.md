# Ng2Modules

This project was generated with [angular-cli](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.0.0-beta.19-3.

## Description
This project is used for the [November, 2016 ng-columbus meetup.](https://www.meetup.com/ng-columbus/events/233156792/) 
The corresponding presentation slides for this project can be found here:  [ng2-modules slides](http://slides.com/tomacree-1/ng2-modules) 

This presentation discusses angular2 NgModule usages and patterns as well as a brief example of how to use es2015 
Typescript modules for import and export.  This project is quite contrived and is meant solely to focus on the essentials
of getting modules to work.

## Branches
The branches in the project correspond to the incrementally built application.  The master branch contains the final
version of the application.

## Resources
I highly recommend the angular.io site and their heroes sample application.  They cover these concepts in fairly complete
depth.  Other excellent resources include the following:
  * http://blog.angular-university.io/angular2-ngmodule/
  * https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/guide/ngmodule.html
